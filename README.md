# Employee-Retention-Analysis
Employee Retention Prediction System:  A data-driven machine learning project designed to predict employee attrition and uncover the key factors driving workforce turnover.  This repository contains exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modelling implemented in Python using industry-standard data science libraries.

**Project Overview**

Employee turnover is expensive, disruptive, and often preventable. This project leverages machine learning techniques to:
Analyze workforce data
Identify patterns influencing employee attrition
Build predictive models to forecast retention risk
Generate actionable insights for HR decision-making
The goal is simple: move from reactive HR management to proactive talent retention.

**Problem Statement**

Organizations struggle to identify employees at risk of leaving before it’s too late. By using historical employee data, we can:

Predict the likelihood of attrition
Detect high-impact factors influencing turnover
Support data-informed workforce strategy
